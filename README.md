# Class-playlist

A collaborative playlist for coding music and practicing using Git and GitHub.

### Format

To add to our playlist, be sure to ```fork``` the repository, then edit the playlist.md file and add an artist , track name, and have it link to the song online. You can optionally add the genre(s) afterwards as well. 

We're writing in [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), which is the main *documentation* format on GitHub.

```
[Artist name - Track name](https://link-to-url.com) - optional genre(s)
```

## TODO

Any other ideas for how to improve this playlist? What other info would people want? How can we make this better? Feel free to [add an issue](https://github.com/lee2sman/class-playlist/issues) for discussion or pull request.
